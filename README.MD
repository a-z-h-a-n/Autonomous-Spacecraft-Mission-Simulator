# 🚀 Autonomous Spacecraft Mission Simulator

This project implements a simplified simulation of an autonomous spacecraft mission using Python. It models core mission components (astronauts, spacecraft, and missions) with object‐oriented classes, and includes unit tests to verify that each component behaves as expected.


The main features include:
- Defining an **Astronaut** class (with experience tracking and attribute introspection)
- Defining a **Spacecraft** class (capacity limits, crew management, and info reporting)
- Defining a **Mission** class (launch/complete logic and mission info reporting)
- Building an **AutonomousSpacecraft** subclass (fixed capacity = 0 and added autonomy level)
- A suite of **unit tests** (using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework) to validate each class’s behavior

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive development and demonstration)  
- **unittest** (built-in Python testing framework)  

No external libraries are required beyond the Python standard library.
